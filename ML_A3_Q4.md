### Q. What is time and space complexity for Logistic regression learning and prediction?

Ans. 

Considering input X having **n** samples and **m** features and **N** be the number of iterations, then

For learning:
* Time Complexity = N*O(mn) = O(Nmn)

* Space Complexity = O(mn)

For prediction:
* Time Complexity = O(mn)

* Space Complexity = O(m)
